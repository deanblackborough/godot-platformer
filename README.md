Platformer starter for Godot - testing out the engine

More details soon, aiming for feature parity with my [Game Maker Platformer](https://github.com/deanblackborough/gm-platformer) project

## Features

- Simple state machine for player movement, Fall, Idle, Jump, Run and Land
- Gravity setting and terminal velocity setting
- Max jumps setting
- Hard land timer setting
- Toggle weapon, alternate idle and run animations when weapon equipped
- Tilemap for grass (sides terrain set)
- Debug panel to show player, state, weapon status, speed etc.

## Next
- Tileset for foliage to add detail
- Switch input checks to base player class and input method so each of the three, input, process and physics_process are used correctly
- Lerping on the animations
- Simple combat, pixel perfect collisions for swings
- Basic enemies, patrolling
- much more.

## To do
Everything to get it equal to the [Game Maker Platformer](https://github.com/deanblackborough/gm-platformer) project and much more
